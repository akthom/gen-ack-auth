As Star and Strauss put it, "what counts as work is a matter of definition" (1999); and in academia, "work" has traditionally been defined as the authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles, books and other media.  This definition renders invisible the para-academic support work (often done by women) that facilitates research.  While these lab technicians, editors and assistants may receive some credit via “acknowledgements” sections, this grants them partial visibility at best — the work is still hidden from the scholarly record, and from the workers’ CVs (Cronin, Shaw LaBarre etc).  

Some fields, though — particularly those that might be described as the technosciences — have seemingly moved towards higher visibility of work over time.  Astronomy and high-energy physics have both been noted for their movement toward “hyperauthorship”, in which hundreds of authors may be included on a given paper (howison and other paper); and in our prior we noted what may be a nascent trend in the same direction in bioinformatics: in the three journals we studied, the number of authors per paper rose, as the number of acknowledgees dropped (Weber & Thomer in press).  We noted, though, that more research was needed to understand the nature of this shift: what particular work roles now “count” as a contribution to the research process? Does this shift in value correct or recapitulate existing gender disparities between the acknowledgees and the authors?

Here, we build on this prior work and present a study of gender disparities between authors lists and acknowledgements statements.  Using natural language processing tools to extract authors lists, authors’ contribution statements and acknowledgement statements from a corpus of bioinformatics journals from PubMed Central’s Open Access Subset (Thomer & Weber, 2014), we will compare trends and gender distribution in these journals over time.  By doing so, we will address the following research questions:
- can we identify a gendered division of labor, or changes in the gendered division of labor over time?
- Are more women being included as authors?  What research roles do they play 
- Are formerly “invisible” research/lab roles being granted more visibility/authorship?
- how are the dynamics between gender/lab roles/what counts as academic work shifting over time? how are they shifting between “straight” scientific vs technoscientific fields?

While this study focuses on the field of bioinformatics, we expect that it will have implications for other fields that are becoming increasingly computational, and in our analysis we will focus on exploring what our findings may mean for the digital humanities [throwing this in here because the conf theme this year is ostensibly on DH]



work in: gender disparities in acknowledgement statements and author’s list demonstrate skewed value system in play  -- in ways that go beyond statistical measures like how much women get paid vs. men, or how many female professors are employed in which department.
