_this is a mess still -- working more on it tomorrow_
from CFP: "technology and social identity and roles:  gender, race, and other identities"


As Star and Strauss put it, "what counts as work is a matter of definition" (1999); and in academia, "work" has traditionally been defined through the proxy of authorship on peer-reviewed journal articles, books and other media.  This definition renders invisible the para-academic support work that facilitates research (particularly in the increasingly & necessarily collabortive  x-informatics fields, such as bioinformatics and even the digital humanities). This work often receives some credit through acknowledgement sections (Cronin, Shaw LaBarre), yet while this may relieve some guilty conscience, these contributions are still hidden from the scholarly record -- and from the contributors' CVs.

- talk about gender disparities btwn acks and authorship: in our prior work looking at technoscience fields, we found that men far outnumbered women as authors -- though the number of female authors _is_ climbing relative to the number of women in acknowledgments
- A more complete portrait of how work is distributed between acknowledgement and authorship is needed to better understand the shifting visibility and invisibility of work in technoscience fields, and to understand what “counts” as a contribution to the research process.


Research questions:
- can we identify a gendered division of labor, or changes in the gendered division of labor over time?
- Are more women being included as authors?
- Are formerly “invisible” research/lab roles being granted more visibility/authorship?
- how are the dynamics between gender/lab roles/what counts as academic work shifting over time? how are they shifting between “straight” scientific vs technoscientific fields?


*Maybe try to find a technohumanistic field to look at -- any open digital humanities journals to scrape?*
