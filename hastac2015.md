As Star and Strauss put it, "what counts as work is a matter of definition" (1999); and in academia, "work" has traditionally been defined as the authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles, books and other media.  This definition renders invisible the para-academic support work (often done by women) that facilitates research. While lab technicians, editors and assistants may receive credit via “acknowledgements” sections, this grants them only partial visibility at best; their work is still hidden from the scholarly record, and from their CVs (e.g. Cronin, Shaw, LaBarre, 2003; 2004).  

That said, some fields — particularly those sometimes called the technosciences — have seemingly moved towards making some forms of support work more visible over time.  Astronomy and high-energy physics have both trended toward “hyperauthorship”, in which numerous technical staff are granted authorship, resulting in hundreds of authors on a given paper (Cronin, 2001). In our prior work we noted what may be a nascent trend in the same direction in bioinformatics. In a survey of three prominant bioinformatics journals, we found that the number of authors per paper rose, as the number of acknowledgees dropped (Weber & Thomer, in press).

More research is needed to understand the nature of this shift, particularly as it relates to existing gender disparities in academic work: what particular work roles now “count” as a contribution to the research process? Does this shift in value correct or recapitulate existing gender disparities between the acknowledgees and the authors?

Here, we present a study of gender disparities between authors lists and acknowledgements statements.  Using natural language processing tools to extract author lists, author contribution statements, and acknowledgement statements from a corpus of open access bioinformatics journals (Thomer & Weber, 2014), we compare trends and gender distribution in these journals over time.  By doing so, we address the following research questions:
- Can we identify a gendered division of labor, or changes in the gendered division of labor over time?
- Are more women being included as authors?  If so, what research roles do they play?
- Are formerly “invisible” research/lab roles being granted more visibility/authorship?
- How are the dynamics between gender, lab roles, and what counts as academic work shifting over time?

We believe that better understanding gender distribution in both author lists and acknowledgment statements will help make visible gendered aspects of the academic value system, in ways that go beyond numerical measures such as how much women are paid compared to men, or how many female professors are employed in a department. While this study focuses on the field of bioinformatics, we expect that it will have implications for other fields that are becoming increasingly computational, and in our analysis we will focus on exploring what our findings may mean for more nascent computational fields such as the digital humanities.
